
## Exercise 1: Create a new sequence

In this sequence, we will create a "hello world" sales sequence for your sellers to follow.

### Task 1: Create new sequence

1. Click on **Sequences** tab in Sales insights settings.

2. Click on **+ New sequence**.

3. You have the option to create a sequence from a number of common templates. You can explore the templates available. When you're ready, select **Start from blank.** 

### Task 2: Create basic information about the sequence

1. Assign name, description and choose the type of table that the sequence will be available for.

2. In the Sequence Name text box, type the sequence name, **[my prefix] Sequence.** 

3. In the **Description** text box, enter sequence description: "This is a test sequence for my test customer."

4. In **Record type**, select Lead (if it is not already selected).

4. Click **Next**.

### Task 3: Choose the first activity for seller to take

Choose the first step for your sellers to take. This can be either sending an email, making a phone call or add a task of your own. In our example, we will start with an email. 

1. Underneath the **Sequence start** tile, select the **+** button.

3. Click on **Email**.

3. In the **Name** text box, enter the name of the email: **[my prefix] Introduction email**.

4. In the **Description** text box, enter the email description: **Introduce lead to the sales team.**

5. If email templates, table specific or global templates, are available in your organization, you can choose an email template. In this case, we will assume that the seller will write their own introduction email.

6. Click **Save**.


### Task 4: Add additional activities for your seller to take

Add additional activities for your sellers to take in an ordered manner,
i.e. seller needs to take the first activity first, then the second and
third and so on.

To persist changes, after adding an activity, click on the **Save** button.

1. Click on the **+** button.

2. Choose the next activity for the seller to take, can be either sending
an email, making a phone call or add a task of your own. You can also
choose **Set wait time** to define a time-interval between activities. In our example we will add a time-interval of 1 hour.

2. Set the **Days** to 5.

3. Click **Save**.

4. In a similar manner we add a phone call activity. Select the **+** sign and select **Phone call**. For name, type **[my prefix] Follow-up call.** Add a description.

5. Save the sequence created to be available for your organization. Select **Save** on the right upper area of the screen.

### Task 5: Activate the sequence

To make the sequence available for sellers to use, activate the sequence.

1. Select **Activate** on the right upper area of the screen.

2. Click **Activate** in the pop-up. 

3. Your sequence will now have a green bar at the top telling you that the sequence was successfully activated.
